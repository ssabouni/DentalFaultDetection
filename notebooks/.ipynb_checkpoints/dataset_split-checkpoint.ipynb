    "\n",
    "## 1. Load Dataset:\n",
    "- The code reads the image files and annotations JSON file.\n",
    "- Ensures the dataset is ready for splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Splitting Dataset:\n",
    "- Uses train_test_split from sklearn to split the dataset:\n",
    "    - 80% for training, further split into 64% training and 16% validation.\n",
    "    - 20% for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Filter Annotations:\n",
    "Filters annotations to ensure only those relevant to each split are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Save Splits:\n",
    "Saves the training, validation, and test annotations to separate JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary:\n",
    "- Logs the number of images and annotations in each split.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Output:\n",
    "- Logs:\n",
    "    - Total number of images and annotations found.\n",
    "    - Number of images and annotations in each split.\n",
    "- Generated Files:\n",
    "    - ../data/train_annotations.json\n",
    "    - ../data/val_annotations.json\n",
    "    - ../data/test_annotations.json\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps:\n",
    "- Verify the splits by checking the generated JSON files.\n",
    "- Use train_annotations.json and val_annotations.json in model_training.ipynb.\n",
    "- Use test_annotations.json for evaluating the model in model_evaluation.ipynb."
